    REWARD PATTERNS - tx type: delgator/validator only
        
    0.  KEYPAIR controls UTXOs
    1.  KEYPAIR issues ADD_VALIDATOR/ADD_DELEGATOR TX
        - validator = adds node to validator (nodeId, start, end, stakeAmount, addressID (rewards destination), fee they charge delegators)
        - delegator = delegates to validator
        - once the tx is put into block and accepted:
            - Input UTXOs
                - UTXOs for staking transfer custody to the protocol (they disappear)
            - Output UTXOs
                - none for staking (output.stake boolean)
                - change UTXOs only
        - you will become a validator/delegator at the startTime
    2. endTime arrives
    3. PROTOCOL automatically issues REMOVE_VALIDATOR / REMOVE_DELEGATOR TX
        - removes the validator/delegator from validator set
        - once the tx is put into block and accepted:
            - Input UTXOs
                - none
            - Output UTXO
                - UTXOs mirroring the ADD_VALIDATOR/ADD_DELGATOR Input UTXOs are created - get your stake back
                - no UTXO appears in tx for reward...        
                - no inputs or outputs for this tx. the output UTXOs are created out of thin air    
    4. PROTOCOL creates a commit or abort block
        - if uptime is good, then you receive the reward
        P-chain blocks contain 1 tx or 0 tx
            - 1 tx = commit block 
                - contains reward UTXO
            - 0 tx = abort block
                - no reward
    5. KEYPAIR spends reward UTXO (it appears in Ortelius)
        - confirm the reward tx (points at the ADD_* tx) is issued on the x-chain
        - possibly issued on p-chain and pvm_export to x-chain to be spent

        but there’s no way to see what data was modified, nor what external contracts were invoked.
